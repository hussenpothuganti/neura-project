# Neura-X Guardian Angel - Integrated Application

## Overview
This is the fixed and integrated version of the Neura-X Guardian Angel application. The frontend and backend have been successfully combined into a single deployable package.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Build Issues**: Resolved missing dependencies and build configuration problems
2. **Frontend Integration**: Successfully built the React frontend and integrated it with the Express backend
3. **Single Server Deployment**: The application now serves both frontend and backend from a single Node.js server
4. **Dependencies**: All required npm packages have been installed and configured
